# Tic Tac Toe Game with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS

This is a simple single-player Tic Tac Toe game built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. In this game, the player competes against the computer (X) to achieve three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player (O) takes turns to play against the computer's random moves.
You can play the game by visiting the [Live Demo](#) link.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Game Rules

The game follows the standard Tic Tac Toe rules:

- The computer (X) takes the first turn.
- The player(O) and the computer (X) take turns to place their marks on the board.
- The first player to achieve three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used
